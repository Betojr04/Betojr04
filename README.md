### Hi there, I'm Alberto Valtierra Jr 👋

<h2>I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer, Traveler, Gymrat, Runner, Hiker, Soccer player, and Huge Nerd</h2> 

As a software developer, I enjoy challenging myself with things outside my comfort zone whether connecting with new people or attacking projects that include a language or a feature(s) I am uncomfortable with. I love pushing myself to be better every day.

🚀 Diving Deep into Mobile Development: Embarking on an exciting journey with Swift to build an innovative application for a tech startup. This venture is a significant step in broadening my full-stack capabilities and exploring the dynamic world of mobile app development.

🌐 Expanding My Full-Stack Expertise: Actively learning Java (SpringBoot) through a hands-on project on developing a comprehensive finance tracker. Each step in this project is a learning opportunity, enhancing my ability to create robust and scalable full-stack solutions.

🔍 Connecting and Collaborating: Open to discussions, collaborations, or freelance opportunities. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects or brainstorming new ideas, I'm here to engage and innovate. Feel free to reach out!
