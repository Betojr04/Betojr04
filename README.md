### Hi there, I'm Alberto Valtierra Jr 👋

I am a full-stack software developer currently studying Finance, Accounting, and Software Engineering. I love programming, traveling, exercising, and meeting new people. 

As a software developer, I enjoy challenging myself with things that are outside of my comfort zone whether connecting with new people or attacking projects that include a language or a feature(s) I am not comfortable with. I love pushing myself to be better every day.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java on the side through college while developing a <span>Virtual trading platform<span>. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any challenging development projects. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help!
- 📫 How to reach me: beto.fintech@outlook.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am training for a marathon at the moment!🏃🏽‍♂️
