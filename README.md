### Hi there, I'm Alberto Valtierra Jr 👋

I am a full-stack software developer and photographer/videographer. I love programming, traveling, exercising, and meeting new people. 

As a software developer I enjoy challenging myself with things that are outside of my comfort zone whether connecting with new people or attacking projects that include a language or a feature(s) I am not comfortable with. I love pushing myself to be better everyday.
